# NS3
In this repo, I explored the Multi-Link Operation (MLO) of Wi-Fi 7. I investigated how varying parameters such as Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), bandwidth, and interference levels affect the delay and throughput performance of Simultaneous Transmission and Reception (STR) in MLO. This research is vital because MLO is a significant advancment in wireless technology, allowing devices to simultaneously send and recieve data across multiple frequency bands, which helps to reduce latency and improve network reliability. To complete this research, I used IEEE 802.11be standard documentation and the NS3 codebase. I wrote a python wrapper for the NS3 library (mainly written in c++) that simulates different bandwidth, interference, traffic load, and MCS conditions. The results are measured through the lens of delay and throughput efficiency.
